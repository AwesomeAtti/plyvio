 * optimistic update overwrote them, captured by the caller — rather than
 * writing every name unconditionally: `findOrCreateTag`/
 * `findOrCreateCollection` are idempotent either way, but a diff is what
 * lets something the user REMOVED actually get removed

 * `v.collections` — an existing one or one newly typed in the dialog
 * (`TokenField.svelte`'s `isNew` tokens carry a synthetic negative id, not
 * a real one) — is resolved by NAME through `findOrCreateTag`/
 * `findOrCreateCollection`, so a new tag is created for real and an
 * existing one is found rather than trusted from a possibly-synthetic
 * client-side id.
 *
 * Reloads via `loadGames()` on success — `loadGames()`'s own doc comment
 * already names "a future favorite/trash/tag/collection write" as a reason
 * to rerun it, and this is that write: `libraryTags`/`libraryCollections`
 * (what the Sidebar and the Edit dialog's own token field read) only pick
 * up a NEWLY CREATED tag or collection once something re-reads them, which
 * `saveGameInfo`'s own optimistic patch — session state only — cannot do.
