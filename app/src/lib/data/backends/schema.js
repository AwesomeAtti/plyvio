/**
 * DDL for a fresh database — what `pwa.js` runs when it creates a new file.
 *
 * Ported from `samples/build_samples.py`'s `GAME_DB_DDL`/`CONFIG_DB_DDL`, which is the
 * schema's other implementation (Python, for building the desktop sample `.db` files).
 * Keep the two in step by hand — there's no single source both languages generate from.
 *
 * `GAME_DB_DDL` covers everything from `database-schema.md` §1–§4 and §7 the
 * application's repository layer (`data/games.js`) reads or writes, plus §6's
 * `positions` table (added 22 Sep 2026 — `data/games.js`'s `readPositionStats` has
 * had a real read path since 21 Sep, and the PWA's own Sample Games seed
 * (`backends/pwa.js`) needs somewhere to write the rows `game/buildPositions.js`
 * computes). §6 still says plainly a game database without the table is valid —
 * `createDatabase()`'s "create new, empty Library" path deliberately does not run
 * this DDL's `positions` statement's equivalent on the desktop side
 * (`samples/build_positions.py` is a separate, later pass there); a brand-new
 * empty database legitimately has no games to derive stats from yet.
 *
 * `CONFIG_DB_DDL` covers `preferences`, `ui_state`, `subscriptions`, plus `libraries`
 * and `engines` — the last two exist here only so `subscriptions.library_id`'s foreign
 * key resolves and so a query against either table (`identify()`'s `CONFIG_TABLES`
 * check, `explorerConnection`'s `readLibraries` call) finds a real, empty table rather
 * than failing. Deliberately NOT wired to real reads/writes from the PWA yet — see
 * `session.js`'s `configConnection` and `stores/settings.js`'s `loadLibraries`/
 * `loadEngines` guards. A `libraries.game_db_path`/filesystem-path row and an
 * `engines.binary_path`/UCI-binary row don't map onto this interim architecture's
 * single in-browser database; both need their own PWA-shaped design before either
 * table gets real content, not a mechanical copy of the desktop shape. It leaves out
 * `catalog_databases`/`catalog_engines` — nothing in `data/config.js` reads them; the
 * download catalogues are a static file today (`settings/databases.js`,
 * `settings/engines.js`), unrelated to this seam.
