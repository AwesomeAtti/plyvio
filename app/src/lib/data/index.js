/**
 * The data seam. §1, §3 and §5 of the schema, behind one interface.
 *
 * The backends are deliberately NOT re-exported here. Each backend is imported
 * only by its own caller — `memory.js` by the tests, `tauri.js`/`pwa.js` by
 * `data/session.js`'s dynamic `import()`s — so a build that never runs in Tauri
 * never pulls `@tauri-apps/plugin-sql` into its bundle, and vice versa. Both
 * `tauri.js` and `pwa.js` are genuine runtime dependencies of their own build
 * now; this file staying backend-agnostic is what keeps each build shipping
 * only the engine it actually uses.
